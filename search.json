Remember, seeking help is a normal part of learning programming!",

It provides a set of tools to reshape, reorganize, and tidy data, making it easier to analyze using dplyr, visualize using ggplot2, and model using statistical methods.

In R, categorical variables are handled using a special data type called a factor. Correct handling of factors is essential for statistical modeling, data summarization, and visualization.\nWhile base R provides basic tools for working with factors, the forcats package (part of the tidyverse) offers a more intuitive, consistent, and powerful approach. This chapter focuses on understanding factors conceptually and using forcats to manage categorical data effectively in modern R workflows.\n## Understanding Factors in R\nA factor is a data structure used to represent categorical data with a fixed set of possible values called levels.\nFactors store data internally as integers with associated labels. This internal structure makes factors efficient and suitable for statistical modeling.\n## Why Factors Matter in Statistics\nFactors are not just labels; they influence how R performs:\nIncorrect factor handling can lead to misleading results, especially in modeling and interpretation.\n## Creating Factors\n### From Character Vectors",

In modern data-driven disciplines, statistics provides the theoretical foundation that guides how data is summarized, modeled, and used for decision-making. In this course, statistics and R are taught together so that statistical thinking is reinforced through computation and real data examples.\nThis chapter introduces the core ideas of statistics that are essential before studying probability theory and statistical inference. The focus here is on understanding what statistics is, why it is needed, and how data is classified and summarized.
