# Basic Plots in R (Base Graphics)

## Introduction

Before the development of advanced visualization systems such as `ggplot2`, R provided a powerful built-in plotting system known as **base graphics**. Even today, base R plots remain widely used due to their **simplicity, speed, and flexibility**, especially for quick exploratory analysis and teaching fundamental graphical concepts.

This chapter introduces the **basic plotting functions in R**, explains how they work, and demonstrates how to customize plots using base graphics. Understanding base plots is important for building strong visualization fundamentals and for interpreting legacy R code commonly found in academic and research settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Base Graphics System in R

Base graphics in R follow a **pen-and-paper model**:

-   A plot is created first
-   Additional elements are added layer by layer

Once a plot is drawn, it cannot be easily modified; instead, it must be redrawn. This contrasts with `ggplot2`, which builds plots declaratively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The `plot()` Function

The `plot()` function is the most fundamental plotting function in R. Its behavior depends on the type of data provided.

### Scatter Plot

``` r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
plot(x, y)
```

This produces a scatter plot showing the relationship between `x` and `y`.

### Plotting a Single Vector

``` r
plot(y)
```

When a single vector is provided, R plots the values against their index.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Customizing Plots

Base R plots can be customized using graphical parameters.

``` r
plot(x, y,
     main = "Simple Scatter Plot",
     xlab = "X values",
     ylab = "Y values",
     col = "blue",
     pch = 19)
```

Common parameters include:

-   `main` – title of the plot
-   `xlab`, `ylab` – axis labels
-   `col` – color
-   `pch` – plotting symbol

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Line Plots

Line plots are useful for showing trends and time-based data.

``` r
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

To add both points and lines:

``` r
plot(x, y, type = "b")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding Elements to an Existing Plot

Additional elements can be added using separate functions.

### Adding Points

``` r
plot(x, y, type = "l")
points(x, y, pch = 16)
```

### Adding Lines

``` r
plot(x, y)
lines(x, y, col = "red")
```

### Adding Text

``` r
text(x, y, labels = y)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Histograms

Histograms display the distribution of a numeric variable.

``` r
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

Customized histogram:

``` r
hist(mtcars$mpg,
     breaks = 10,
     col = "lightgray",
     main = "Histogram of MPG",
     xlab = "Miles per Gallon")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Boxplots

Boxplots summarize the distribution of data using quartiles.

``` r
boxplot(mtcars$mpg)
```

Grouped boxplot:

``` r
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars,
        main = "MPG by Number of Cylinders",
        xlab = "Cylinders",
        ylab = "Miles per Gallon")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bar Plots

Bar plots are used for categorical data or summarized values.

``` r
counts <- table(mtcars$cyl)
barplot(counts)
```

Customized bar plot:

``` r
barplot(counts,
        col = "steelblue",
        main = "Car Counts by Cylinders",
        xlab = "Cylinders",
        ylab = "Frequency")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pie Charts

Pie charts show proportions of categories.

``` r
pie(counts)
```

Although easy to create, pie charts are generally discouraged in statistical analysis due to difficulty in comparing values accurately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Multiple Plots in One Window

The `par()` function allows multiple plots to be displayed together.

``` r
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(mtcars$mpg)
hist(mtcars$mpg)
boxplot(mtcars$mpg)
barplot(counts)
```

Reset layout after plotting:

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saving Plots to Files

Plots can be saved using graphical devices.

``` r
png("scatter_plot.png")
plot(x, y)
dev.off()
```

Common devices include `png()`, `pdf()`, and `jpeg()`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When to Use Base R Plots

Base plots are especially useful for:

-   Quick exploratory analysis
-   Teaching fundamental plotting concepts
-   Simple visualizations without heavy customization
-   Working with legacy R scripts

For complex, publication-quality graphics, `ggplot2` is generally preferred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

This chapter introduced **basic plotting in R using base graphics**. You learned how to:

-   Create scatter, line, histogram, box, bar, and pie plots
-   Customize plot appearance
-   Add elements to existing plots
-   Arrange multiple plots
-   Save plots to external files

Understanding base R graphics provides a strong foundation for advanced visualization techniques and helps in interpreting a wide range of existing R code.
