# Classification

## Introduction

Classification is a fundamental task in statistics, machine learning, and data science, where the objective is to **assign observations to predefined categories or classes** based on their features. Unlike regression, which predicts continuous outcomes, classification deals with **categorical response variables**.

Classification problems arise across many domains, including medicine (disease diagnosis), finance (credit risk), marketing (customer segmentation), and text analytics (spam detection). This chapter introduces the **conceptual foundations of classification**, common types of classification problems, and the general workflow used in classification analysis. Detailed algorithms and implementations will be covered in subsequent chapters.

## What Is Classification?

Classification is a supervised learning task in which:

- The response variable (target) is categorical
- Each observation belongs to one of a finite number of classes
- A model is trained using labeled data

Examples include:

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam
- Diagnosing patients as diseased or healthy
- Predicting customer churn (yes/no)

---

## Types of Classification Problems

### Binary Classification

Binary classification involves two possible classes.

Examples:

- Pass / Fail
- Positive / Negative
- Yes / No

Binary classification is the most common and forms the basis for many advanced methods.

---

### Multiclass Classification

Multiclass classification involves more than two classes.

Examples:

- Blood group classification
- Handwritten digit recognition
- Product category prediction

---

### Multilabel Classification

In multilabel classification, an observation can belong to **multiple classes simultaneously**.

Example:

- Tagging news articles with multiple topics

---

## Features and Class Labels

- **Features (predictors)** are variables used to make predictions
- **Class labels** are the categorical outcomes

In R, features are usually stored as columns in a data frame, while the class label is represented as a factor.

```r
data <- data.frame(
  Age = c(25, 40, 30, 50),
  Income = c(30000, 60000, 45000, 80000),
  Purchase = factor(c("No", "Yes", "No", "Yes"))
)
```

## Classification vs Regression

| Aspect | Classification | Regression |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Target variable | Categorical | Continuous |
| Output | Class or probability | Numeric value |
| Examples | Disease status | Blood pressure |

Understanding this distinction is crucial for selecting appropriate models.

---

## Decision Boundary Concept

A classification model learns a **decision boundary** that separates different classes in the feature space.

- Linear boundaries are simple and interpretable
- Nonlinear boundaries can capture complex patterns

The choice of boundary affects accuracy and generalization.

---

## Common Classification Algorithms (Overview)

Some widely used classification methods include:

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each method has different assumptions, strengths, and limitations.

---

## Logistic Regression as a Classification Model

Although called regression, **logistic regression** is a classification method used for binary outcomes.

- Models the probability of class membership
- Uses a logistic (sigmoid) function
- Outputs probabilities between 0 and 1

```r
model <- glm(Purchase ~ Age + Income,
             data = data,
             family = binomial)
summary(model)
```

Logistic regression is widely used due to its interpretability.

---

## Probabilistic Interpretation

Most classification models estimate **class probabilities**.

```r
predict(model, type = "response")
```

A decision threshold (commonly 0.5) is then applied to assign class labels.

---

## Training and Testing Data

To evaluate classification models fairly, data is typically split into:

- Training set – used to build the model
- Test set – used to evaluate performance

This helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

---

## Model Evaluation in Classification

Classification performance is evaluated using several metrics:

- Accuracy
- Sensitivity (Recall)
- Specificity
- Precision
- F1-score

The choice of metric depends on the problem context.

---

## Confusion Matrix

A **confusion matrix** summarizes prediction results.

```r
table(Actual = data$Purchase,
      Predicted = ifelse(predict(model, type = "response") > 0.5,
                         "Yes", "No"))
```

It provides insight into different types of classification errors.

---

## Imbalanced Classes

In many real-world problems, one class may be much more frequent than others.

Examples:

- Fraud detection
- Rare disease diagnosis

Accuracy alone can be misleading in such cases, and alternative evaluation metrics are needed.

---

## Assumptions and Challenges in Classification

Common challenges include:

- Overfitting
- Multicollinearity among predictors
- Noisy or irrelevant features
- Class imbalance

Understanding data characteristics is essential for effective classification.

---

## Classification Workflow

A typical classification analysis follows these steps:

1. Data collection and cleaning
2. Feature selection and transformation
3. Model selection
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Interpretation and deployment

---

## Applications of Classification

Classification methods are widely used in:

- Medical diagnosis and prognosis
- Credit scoring and risk assessment
- Marketing response prediction
- Text and document classification
- Image and signal recognition
